## 🔧 Contact Page Note

If you're experiencing a 404 error with the contact page:
1. **Local Testing**: Make sure you're opening the files in the same directory
2. **File Path**: Try opening `contact.html` directly: `file:///Users/bradleysimpson/Native Restoration/contact.html`
3. **GitHub Pages**: The issue should resolve once deployed to GitHub Pages

The contact.html file exists and is properly structured. The 404 error is likely due to local file path issues that will be resolved when deployed to a web server.
