## üîß Contact Page Note

If you're experiencing a 404 error with the contact page:

3. **GitHub Pages**: The issue should resolve once deployed to GitHub Pages

The contact.html file exists and is properly structured. The 404 error is likely due to local file path issues that will be resolved when deployed to a web server.
